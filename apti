Solve The Puzzle!

The Rat problem	 … 								10 marks

This is a very famous but inhuman problem. A few scientists in Area-51 (If you know what 
area-51 is, then please write a few lines about it, you will get some extra marks :-) ) were 
conducting an experiment about inventing an immortal drug.

If any human will take that drug, they will become immortal. 

They developed 100 samples of the immortal drugs. However, one of the scientist 
dropped a bombshell stating that by mistake one of the sample of the drug was not 
prepared correctly and it is fatal.

Whoever will take that drug, he will die after 1 hour! Now, the scientists have a task of finding out that fatal drug. To find out they have some rats available. They can test the drug on the rats. 

They need to use minimum number of rats (as PETA are always running after them) to find out the defective drug within 1 hours. 

Can you find out a methodology to use minimum number of rats to find out the defective?
Hint: the answer is less than 10.


* Area 51 is a Secret Research Station in USA which studies UFO and presence of Alien species!!! Like we see in movies :) *

*We divide samples into two sets A and B. Take out small mix of all samples from A and B. Test them on two Rats so one of them will die and we know the other 50 drugs are safe. In this way we continuously follow this process for Sets of 25, 12-13, 6-6, 3-3, 2-1
Hence we will lose only 6 or 7 rats*
