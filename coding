1) Help Sheeba out 									    10 marks

Sheeba was asked by a Recruiter to write down 100 numbers (1-100) randomly 
but making sure that no number is repeated twice. At the end, the Recruiter found 
out that Sheeba had done her work perfectly, but committed just one mistake of 
repeating a number twice. Recruiter asked Sheeba that she recruiter her only 
under one condition! If Sheeba is able to find out the only number which she is 
repeated in an optimised manner.

Can you write a pseudocode, which can help Sheeba to find out the number which 
got repeated twice?


ANS-1) Create a temp array temp[] of size n =100 with all initial values as 0.
2) Traverse the input array arr[], and do following for each arr[i]
……a) if(temp[arr[i]] == 0) temp[arr[i]] = 1;
……b) if(temp[arr[i]] == 1) output “arr[i]” //repeating
